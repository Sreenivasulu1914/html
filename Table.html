								 <tr>
								       <td colspan="2">A defining trilogy of 21st-century cinema that is comprised of three of the greatest and most exciting action films ever made, Christopher Nolan’s legendary The Dark Knight Trilogy is an enduring highlight of modern film. It follows Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale), a billionaire from Gotham City, as he begins using his resources and wealth to stand against the wave of crime and corruption that has placed Gotham in a stranglehold, donning the guise of Batman to become a symbol of hope and prosperity.

                                                  There is perhaps no greater testament to its undying presence in pop culture than the litany of iconic quotes that spawned from the movies, with many of the trilogy’s best lines still easily identifiable all these years later. Ranging from heroic ideals to wise words and even just some excellent quips from the villains, the 10 best quotes of The Dark Knight Trilogy represent Nolan’s knack for dialogue at its absolute best.
