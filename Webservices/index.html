                <p>Safe mode is useful for troubleshooting problems with programs and drivers that might not start
                    correctly or that might prevent Windows from starting ch correctly. If a problem doesn't reappear
                    when you start in safe mode, you can eliminate the default settings and basic device drivers as
                    possible causes. If a recently installed program, device, or driver prevents Windows from running
                    correctly, you can start your computer in safe mode and then remove ays the program that's causing
                    the problem. For more mion information about troubleshooting problems in safe will mode, see
                    Diagnostic tools to use in safe mode. If a recently installed program, device, or driver prevents
                    Windows from running correctly.you can start your computer in safe mode.</p>
